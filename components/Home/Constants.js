                The onset of the recent Covid crisis has caused a systemic shift away from the traditional office routine of work, towards remote working, evident with polls showing an almost 30% of firms having a permanent remote work policy <i>( Wikibon, 2022)</i> . However, contrarian studies have suggested that a decrease in productivity ensued as a result as seen in Ithaca Inc. Thus, it is imperative that systemic reversal towards office-based working is needed. As such, there is a need for change management <i>( Goffin and Mitchell, 2017 )</i> that is based on the foundations of Kurt Lewin's 1947 work on field theory that is popularized for its 'deeply enriched [our] understanding of how change happens' ( Schein Edgar H , 1996 ). Lewis proposed with empirical evidence through an action based approach that the organizational behaviour of a 'body' can be predicted based on its encompassing intricacies, within a 'life space' <i>( Bernard B , 2013 )</i>. Changes put forward by field theory are bought about the tensions between such intricacies, and their relative 'valence' being the importance of an action. Such  change occurence can be perceived as having three stages; 'Unfreezing' being the introduction of tension in the system, 'Moving' being the actual net change occuring' and 'Refreezing' being the consolidation of such change.

                <br />
                However, there are shortcoming of a linear model in an unpredicable, fluid reality; '[it] has become obsolete [because] it applies to a world of certainty and predictability [where it] was developed' <i>( Cummings S et al , 2015 )</i>. Thus, the following strategy is heavily influenced by JP Potter's 1996 Change model <i>( Applebaum H et al, 2012 )</i>, and can be seen as a consolidated iteration.

            A sense of dramaticness is needed to initiate the process of change as the diminishing tensions and return to initia will result in an insufficient 'power and credibility to initiate the required change program' ( Applebaum H et al , 2012 ). 

            Recommendations to create this urgency. 

            Emphasize credible sources by criticizing the decrease in performance of Ithaca. Studies have shown an increase in normal working hours as a result of 8-10% decrease in net productivity ( Gibbs M et al , 2017) . 

            Favouring a top-down approach, both the valence and frequency of communications about the advantages of an office-based approach should be used to increase a sense of 'survivor's guilt' ( Schein Edgar H , 1996 ). This aligns with the field-based theory, where disconfirmation of existing beliefs, i.e. remote work being net advantageous is dissolved via repetitive exposure to opposing information. 

            Balancing the sense of urgency with an assurance that risks in the change are mitigated, known as inducing psychological safety  ( Schein Edgar H , 1996 ).

            As change management requires a focal point where leadership is found ( Goffin and Mitchell , 2017 ), there needs to a group of 'change agents' that can be relied upon when in the 'Moving' stage of change. 

Ithaca should create such a coalition with democratic intention. This means having representative of each division based on their expertise to give insights on the driving forces that occur within each division. As well, these representatives need to have credibility of their expertise. Such emphasis on exportise and credibility are known to have a relationship in predicting the success of change strategies ( Lines R, 2007 ) .

            The creation of a shared vision that can be diffused through a top-down approach is known to benefit group alignment and steers away individuals within a group from learning anxiety; the tendency to avoid acceptance of new knowledge as it causes bias deanchoring, towards optimism about the change. Requirements found within successful visions are based around it needing to be 'clear, consistent and well articulated' ( Stanifort D, 1996 ). 

            The latter part of this stage is the effective and precise communication of the vision through a top-down approach from the formed coalition. This is evident with post-analysis of firms transitioning through change noting that 'survivors'  who had effective management communication tended to respond to the change positively ( Naulissen P et al , 2008 ) .

            Once the period of 'Unfreezing' ends the immediate action taken should be to build emprical evidence that change bought about is advantageous through recognizing short term wins, which increases the psychological safety to balance the previous building of urgency. Further, short-term wins are known to increase the self-confidence of the employees back in office , after doubting the notion that remote work is net beneficial, mitigating the previous obstacle of learning anxiety.

The evaluation of short-term wins against criterias set out by the long-term change can be used to realign Ithaca's strategy as well as increase the valence of pro-change driving forces as notioned by the Lewin's field theory. Overtime, the building of momentum from such short-term wins will attain a 'critical mass of accumulating support' ( KJ Jansen, 2004 ) . This can be measured by the growing number of empoyees that have reported working from office regularly, with such reversal already being shown in relevant studies ( superjob.ru, 2021 ).

            The momentum built upon incentivizing workers to return to an office-based work should at this point be large enough to restructure the existing standards of remote work being net beneficial. As such, the change should be in place without the needed urgency for a sustained period of time, achieving 'insitutionalization'; a change that 'has become part of the ongoing, everyday activities of the organization' ( Jacobs Ronald L , 2002 ). 

Specifically, Ithaca can achieve this by 

Ensuring that the new change coalition peronsifies the aforementioned criteria of expertise, credibility and alignment with the vision. 

Retrospective reporting that the outcomes of returning to office is net positive over the previous remote norm.
